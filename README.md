Classical book designers kept a secret, well-known to those in the field but otherwise unknown, of how to lay out page elements and margins in harmony. 

Modern desktop publishing packages gave ordinary people the ability to lay out and design newsletters, magazines, and books. Missing from these tools, however, was the knowledge of page layout, the classical canons passed down through the ages.

New Canon bridges the gap between old and new, making harmonious page and spread layouts right in the browser. Start from scratch, use a classical canon, or access and contribute to a library of new canons.
